Los-ML-Tools
=================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martelogan/los-ml-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martelogan/los-ml-tools)

Description
-------------

This repo, constructed from Kenneth Reitz's [sample python boilerplate](https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod), serves as a template for python projects developed by Logan Martel (github username: [martelogan](https://github.com/martelogan)).

Creating a Project from this Skeleton
-------------

The following table illustrates steps required to setup a basic python project from this skeleton:

## Status of Skeleton Tasks

- [x] Clone this template project
- [x] Find & Replace all instances of _Los-ML-Tools_ (case-sensitive) with your project name
- [x] Find & Replace all instances of _los-ml-tools_ (case-sensitive) with your project name
- [x] Find & Replace all instances of _los_ml_tools_ (case-sensitive) with your project name
- [ ] Modify this README (and subdirectory READMEs) with general project documentation
- [ ] Modify project contributors as necessary under: [AUTHORS](AUTHORS), [setup.py](setup.py), [docs/conf.py](docs/conf.py), and all README citations
- [ ] Delete the cloned .git subdirectory, run `git init`, and establish the new remote project repository
- [ ] Replace this README section with a project status checklist

Installation
-------------

1. Make sure you have all the dependencies needed to build this project. In particular, immediately after git clone, you should be able to successfully build 
the project from a command-line environment under **[Python 2.7](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)** 
via the command:
```bash
   python setup.py develop
```

2. The recommended IDE for developer consistency is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). 
Leveraging PyCharm, it would be ideal for project contributors to ensure that code conforms to [PEP 8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

(**RECOMMENDATION:** Ideally, it is advised to manage Python virtual environments via [`conda`](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) in order to safely segregate module dependencies. In this case, it is recommended to locallize [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installations during conda environment creation, to avoid dependency conflicts, by instantiating the environment with its own [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) setup, Ã  la `conda create --name custom_venv_name pip`. Alternatively, a basic [`conda`](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) venv, equipped with its own localized [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), can be configured from this project directory simply by running `conda env create -f environment.yml` and then [activating the environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) (linux example: `source activate los-ml-tools`)).

Development
------------

Our development workflow will be simple:

**Always develop on your own branch. Only merge code to Master via PR's. Only merge code that has no conflicts with master. Only merge code that builds successfully via _python setup.py develop_**.

Execution
------------

The first thing we do is import the module and get an ``ExampleClass`` 
object.

```python
   >>> from los-ml-tools import ExampleClass as Ex
   >>> example = Ex("hello")
   >>> ...
```
